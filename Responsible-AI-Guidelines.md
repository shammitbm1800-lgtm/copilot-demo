# Responsible AI Guidelines

## 1. Reviewing and Validating AI-Generated Code
- Always inspect AI-suggested code before using it.
- Check logic, edge cases, and security issues manually.
- Avoid blindly accepting large or complex auto-generated snippets.

## 2. Handling Sensitive Data Securely
- Never include API keys, passwords, or tokens in source code.
- Store sensitive values in environment variables or secret managers.
- Remove any AI-generated suggestions that expose private data.

## 3. Acknowledging AI Contributions Ethically
- Mention when AI tools helped generate major code sections or documentation.
- Do not claim AI-generated work as completely original if it’s not.
- Ensure AI output does not copy or violate someone else’s licensed code.
